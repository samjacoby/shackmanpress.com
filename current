Oak Knoll Fest was great. We sold some books. Bought some others. And met many a fine press<em>volk</em>. Of special note are the gentleman of <a href="http://thedaleguild.com/" target="_blank">The Dale Guild Type Foundry</a>.

The Press is heading to <a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/fest" target="_blank">Oak Knoll Fest!</a> In preparation, we printed our first business cards.<a href="imgs/news/shackman.business.card-full.jpg" title="No @ signs.

I'm pleased to announce that Morris Dickstein will be writing an afterword for our next publication &mdash; Delmore Schwartz's "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities." Keep an eye out.

A bit of a non-sequitur, but we're proud of everything we do &mdash; and we've made a desk! Sweat of the brow, and all that. <a href="imgs/news/desk.cambridge-full.jpg" title="It's coated in a resin secreted by the female lac bug." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/desk.cambridge.jpg" alt=""></a><br /><span class="small-light">Ah, what is a man without a desk!</span>

What do you know! There <em>is</em> <a href="http://smallcaps-blog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">somewhere</a> to get pillow-soft letterpressed stationery in Berlin. And just when we've got a foot out the door. (Thanks <a target="_blank" href="http://www.katranpress.com">Kat Ran!</a>)

At the journey's end<br />Berlin is a summerless city<br />But nice all the same.

All is in disarray! Travel! Space! Time! We're going to Istanbul!
2.6.2010
We just wanted to let you know (well, well in advance), that we'll be making an appearence at the <a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/fest/" target="_blank">Oak Knoll Fest</a> in October. The team's wardrobe is being meticulously planned.
21.5.2010
We've put up <a href="includes/pdf/Anton Chekhov - The Student - Michael Henry Heim - Barry Moser - Shackman Press 2010.pdf">"The Student,"</a> a story in <em>Easter Week</em>, for your perusing pleasure.<a href="imgs/news/chekhov.student.moser.shackman-full.jpg" title="The real thing is way bigger&mdash;and more paper-ey." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/chekhov.student.moser.shackman.jpg" alt=""></a><br /><span class="small-light">A spread from <em>Easter Week</em>.</span>

We've got a new webhost! Undoubtedly, that will mean nothing at all&mdash;but we're pleased, and looking forward to improving the Shackman website with an area where visitors can post pictures of their cats.
15.5.2010  
Brainstorming is underway for the Delmore Schwartz book. Right now, I'm thinking laser cutting, mostly inspired by the <a href="http://www.olafureliasson.net/publications/your_house_1.html" target="_blank">Olafur Eliasson</a> house-in-a-book <a href="http://www.archicentral.com/your-house-laser-cut-art-book-by-olafur-eliasson-8358/" target="_blank">boondoggle</a>. It is almost exactly what it sounds like.

In an unlikely flash of mechnical genius, the Press has repaired its wheels!<a href="imgs/news/bike.berlin-full.gif" title="It's hard to tell from the angle, but it's a Mercedes." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/bike.berlin.jpg" alt=""></a><br /><span class="small-light">The Shackman Cruiser's jury-rigged crank.</span>

Shackman Press hits the media circus! <em>Easter Week</em> makes a modest appearance in the <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/" target="_blank"><em>Times Literary Supplement</em></a>. <a href="imgs/news/chekhov.tls.ad-full.gif" title="It may look small, but this is actually a 9 &times; 12 page." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/chekhov.tls.ad.gif" alt=""></a>

A re-print of Delmore Schwart'z  classic short story <em>In Dreams Begin Responsibilities</em>, a long-time favorite, is in the (distant) offing.

Promise aside, we've only now managed to snap a casually artful composition of the signatures for the Wei&szlig; specimen book. One of these weekends, there'll be a binding marathon.<a href="imgs/news/weiss.specimen.shackman-full.gif" title="This is the German version of things." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/weiss.specimen.shackman.gif" alt=""></a>

The first copies of <em>Easter Week</em> have shipped! Euphoria! Glee! Onward!

The Press has moved quarters, with a lovely view of a local soccer field. It's around (or exactly) <em><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=firefox-a&q=44+puecklerstr.+10997+berlin&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=P%C3%BCcklerstra%C3%9Fe+44,+Kreuzberg+10997+Berlin,+Germany&ei=wKa1S5KyJMjG_gaZ6MTADg&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA&t=h&z=16" target="_blank">here</a></em>.

Mainz is the <a href="http://www.stadt-der-wissenschaft.de/" target="_blank"><em>Stadt der Wissenschaft 2011</em></a>. What a coup &mdash; and just as we're leaving! At least it's beautiful in Berlin! <a href="imgs/news/berlin.spring2010-full.gif" title="Alexendarplatz, Berlin." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/berlin.spring2010.gif" alt=""></a>
24.3.2010
Astonishingly, we made it to Berlin without mishap. The press's sharp little <em>gangschultung</em> Fiat stalled a dozen or so times, but miraculously, we escaped disaster.
21.3.2010
Mainz, Mainz, Mainz. Wir sind weg gegangen. It treated us well. 
16.3.2010
Overtime at the Druckladen this week, trying to finish up an type specimen book on Emil Wei&szlig; before the move to Berlin. Frantic!<br><a href="imgs/news/weiss.typebook.shackman-full.gif" title="A four-up sheet from <em>A Few Faces of Emil Rudolf Wei&szlig;</em>" rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/weiss.typebook.shackman.jpg" alt=""></a><br><span class="small-light" style="color:red">UPDATE:</span> It's done, but all the sheets are packed away. I'll get photos up at some point. Still have to figure out the covers, and how to bind three tiny signatures.
15.3.2010
It's nice to be back in Mainz, after a lovely trip through the Low Countries. We were planning on putting up some photos of the fantastic Plantin Musuem in Antwerp, but wouldn't you know it &mdash; we didn't take any.
3.3.2010
Spring is coming to Mainz.<br><a href="imgs/news/mainz.spring2010-full.gif" title="Along the Rhine, March 2010." rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/mainz.spring2010.jpg" alt=""></a><br>

I've been trying to take a decent photo of the Celan book for ages, but light &amp; my own limitations have always conspired against me. I was finally forced to crack-down and get something decent to include with the upcoming review in the <a href="http://fpba.org" target="_blank">FPBA's</a> journal, <em><a href="http://www.fpba.com/parenthesis/about.html">Parenthesis</a>.</em><a href="imgs/news/celan.spread.parenthesis-full.gif" rel="prettyPhoto" title="Title spread from <em>Paul Celan: A Reading for Group 47</em>"><img class="picture" src="imgs/news/celan.spread.parenthesis.gif" alt=""></a><br>

We only affiliate ourself with the finest! Michael Henry Heim's latest translation (from the Dutch no less), has been short-listed for a <a href="http://www.archipelagobooks.org/bk.php?id=58" target="_blank">dizzying prize</a> of some kind! Congrats to him &amp; Archipelago Books! <span class="small-light">(Thanks, Carolyn Gaebler!)</span>

It's the 150th anniversary of Chekhov's birth this year, January 29, 1860, and we at the Press celebrated by eating Gooseberries.
10.2.2010
Publishing literary translation is in the limelight: there's a (very) oblique reference to <em>Easter Week</em> in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Translators-Struggle-to-Prove/63542/?key=SzglJ1FrMiQeYnE0eiBCKCYBbnMtdRotOCVEYHkaYFFc" target="_blank">this</a> Chronicle article on translation &amp; publishing. That and a glamour shot of Michael Henry Heim.&nbsp;<span class="small-light">(Thanks, Ned Levin!)</span>

Sarah Creighton has made a pastepaper for the endsheets of the <em>Easter Week</em> deluxe edition. The covers will be a charcoal goatskin.<br> <img class="picture" src="imgs/news/pastepaper.creighton.jpg" alt="sarah creighton pastepaper"><br>Beautiful, eh? Note the red-pencil line across the middle. Classy.

Inspired by the 72-point <a href="http://www.typeoff.de/?p=29" target="_blank">Wallau</a> that the Druckladen has on hand, I printed out a dozen or so broadsides displaying the alphabet &amp; ligatures. It's lovely. Hilariously, the case is missing a capital "W" so I can't print the name of the font <em>in</em> Wallau. I'll figure something out. Neuland, maybe? <br><span class="small-light" style="color:red">UPDATE:</span> Done! Take a look.<br><img src="imgs/news/wallau.broadside.gif" alt="wallau broadside">

I can <em>see</em> my breath. That wouldn't be odd in winter, but I'm inside. Going heatless, of course, is hip in these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/garden/21cold.html?em" target="_blank"><span style="color:green">green</span></a> days.<br>I'm heading out of town for a few days. In the meantime, think about picking up <em>Easter Week</em>.
24.1.2010
Back in Mainz! It's snowing, which seems to surprise everyone. The apartment is <em>cold</em>. Everyone says it hasn't been this cold in 30 years.
20.1.2010
The printing is done. Things turned out beautifully. I'll get some photos and such up.
15.1.2010
In Florence, printing away! It's looking beautiful -- especially Barry Moser's exquisite engravings. 
8.1.2010
Heading out to Boston on Monday -- printing by Tuesday! Keep an eye out for more information on the Chekhov book.
7.1.2010
I've just spoken with Barry Moser, who's got the wood engravings in the pipeline. Speaking of which, I just bought (the trade edition) copy of his Bible. It's an astonishing piece of work. Take a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pennyroyalcaxton.com/">look.</a>
22.12.2009
Things are underway. The manuscript has been sent off to the <a href="http://www.mwbixler.com">Bixlers</a>, and I'll be heading to Florence to get printing come January. It's snowing outside. 
7.12.2009
The paper for the Chekhov book has arrived! Goodness, that stuff is smooth. It must be calendared about twelve-thousand times. I'm going to smuggle it into the US in my luggage. Brilliant.
