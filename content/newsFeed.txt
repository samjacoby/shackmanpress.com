Brainstorming is underway for the Delmore Schwartz book. Right now, I'm thinking laser cutting, mostly inspired by the <a href="http://www.olafureliasson.net/publications/your_house_1.html" target="_blank">Olafur Eliasson</a> house-in-a-book <a href="http://www.archicentral.com/your-house-laser-cut-art-book-by-olafur-eliasson-8358/" target="_blank">boondoggle</a>.

Overtime at the Druckladen this week, trying to finish up an type specimen book on Emil Wei&szlig; before the move to Berlin.

It's nice to be back in Mainz, after a lovely trip through the Low Countries. We were planning on putting up some photos of the fantastic Plantin Musuem in Antwerp, but wouldn't you know it &mdash; we didn't take any.

I've been trying to take a decent photo of the Celan book for ages, but light &amp; my own limitations have always conspired against me.

It's the 150th anniversary of Chekhov's birth this year, January 29, 1860, and we at the Press celebrated by eating Gooseberries.
10.2.2010
Publishing literary translation is in the limelight: there's a (very) oblique reference to <em>Easter Week</em> in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Translators-Struggle-to-Prove/63542/?key=SzglJ1FrMiQeYnE0eiBCKCYBbnMtdRotOCVEYHkaYFFc" target="_blank">this</a> Chronicle article on translation &amp; publishing.

Inspired by the 72-point <a href="http://www.typeoff.de/?p=29" target="_blank">Wallau</a> that the Druckladen has on hand, I printed out a dozen or so broadsides displaying the alphabet &amp; ligatures. It's lovely. Hilariously, the case is missing a capital "W" so I can't print the name of the font <em>in</em> Wallau. I'll figure something out. Neuland, maybe? <br><span class="small-light" style="color:red">UPDATE:</span> Done! Take a look.<br><img src="imgs/news/wallau.broadside.gif" alt="wallau broadside">

I can <em>see</em> my breath. That wouldn't be odd in winter, but I'm inside. Going heatless, of course, is hip in these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/garden/21cold.html?em" target="_blank"><span style="color:green">green</span></a> days.<br>I'm heading out of town for a few days.

Back in Mainz! It's snowing, which seems to surprise everyone. The apartment is <em>cold</em>. Everyone says it hasn't been this cold in 30 years.
20.1.2010
The printing is done. Things turned out beautifully. I'll get some photos and such up.
15.1.2010
In Florence, printing away! It's looking beautiful -- especially Barry Moser's exquisite engravings. 
8.1.2010
Heading out to Boston on Monday -- printing by Tuesday! Keep an eye out for more information on the Chekhov book.
7.1.2010
I've just spoken with Barry Moser, who's got the wood engravings in the pipeline. Speaking of which, I just bought (the trade edition) copy of his Bible. It's an astonishing piece of work. Take a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pennyroyalcaxton.com/">look.</a>
22.12.2009
Things are underway. The manuscript has been sent off to the <a href="http://www.mwbixler.com">Bixlers</a>, and I'll be heading to Florence to get printing come January. It's snowing outside. 
7.12.2009
The paper for the Chekhov book has arrived! Goodness, that stuff is smooth. It must be calendared about twelve-thousand times. I'm going to smuggle it into the US in my luggage. Brilliant.
